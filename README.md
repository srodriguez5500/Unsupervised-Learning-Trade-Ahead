# Unsupervised-Learning-Trade-Ahead
## Project for Unsupervised Learning: 
Trade&Ahead is a financial consultancy firm who provide their customers with personalized investment strategies. They have hired you as a Data Scientist and provided you with data comprising stock price and some financial indicators for a few companies listed under the New York Stock Exchange. They have assigned you the tasks of analyzing the data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group.

## My Learning:
This project involved applying clustering techniques to group similar stocks, helping customers make informed investment decisions aligned with their goals and needs. Hierarchical (agglomerative) clustering and K-means clustering were implemented and compared to identify the most effective method for creating segment profiles. To determine the optimal number of clusters in K-means, the elbow method and silhouette scores were evaluated. For hierarchical clustering, various combinations of distance metrics and linkage methods were tested to identify the one with the highest cophenetic correlation. Additionally, dendrograms were analyzed to determine the best distance metric and the optimal number of clusters for segmentation. The analysis revealed that the created segments shared many common attributes, indicating sufficient segmentation. As a result, detailed profiles were developed for each stock cluster to support the needs of potential investors.
